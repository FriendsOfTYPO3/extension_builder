TYPO3 Extension ``extension_builder``
=====================================

The *Extension Builder* helps you to develop a TYPO3 extension based on the
domain-driven MVC framework `Extbase <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/book-extbasefluid/8.7/en-us/0-Introduction/Index.html>`__
and the templating engine `Fluid <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/book-extbasefluid/8.7/en-us/8-Fluid/Index.html>`__,
(the linked documentations are written for TYPO3 v8, but also applicable to
TYPO3 v7).

It provides a graphical modeler to define domain objects and their relations
as well as associated controllers with basic actions.
It also provides a properties form to define extension metadata, frontend
plugins and backend modules that use the previously defined controllers
and actions.
Finally, it generates a basic extension that can be installed
and further developed.
