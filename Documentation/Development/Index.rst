Development
===========

If you want to participate in the development of the Extension Builder, set up
your local development environment as usual.

.. hint::

   This section is not completely finished. You also need some npm commands for
   compiling the React JS app. This will be added in the future.

Compile SCSS
============

The preferred way to compile the CSS sources from the SCSS files is to use yarn,
but npm also works. In this case, simply replace :bash:`yarn` with :bash:`npm`.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd Resources/Public/jsDomainModeling/
   yarn install
   yarn build-css

DDEV environment
================

We are planning to also include a DDEV environment for the Extension Builder which helps you to get started with the development of the Extension Builder. This will be added soon.
