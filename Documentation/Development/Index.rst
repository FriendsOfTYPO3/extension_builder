If you want to participate in the development of the Extension Builder, set up
your local development environment as usual.

Compile SCSS
============

The preferred way to compile the CSS sources from the SCSS files is to use yarn,

   cd Resources/Public/jsDomainModeling/
   yarn install
   yarn build-css
