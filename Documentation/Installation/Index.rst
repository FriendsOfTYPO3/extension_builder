.. _installation_composer:

Composer mode
=============

If your TYPO3 installation uses Composer, install the latest Extension Builder
through:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require friendsoftypo3/extension-builder

If you are not using the latest version of the Extension Builder, you need to
add a version constraint, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   composer require friendsoftypo3/extension-builder:"^10.0"

and activate it as follows:

-  Navigate to :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions > Installed Extensions`
-  Search for `extension_builder`
-  Activate the extension by clicking on the :guilabel:`Activate` button in the
   :guilabel:`A/D` column

.. _installation_legacy:

Legacy mode
===========

If you are working with a TYPO3 installation that does not use Composer, install
the extension in the Extension Manager:

-  Navigate to :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions > Get Extensions`.
-  Click on :guilabel:`Update now`
-  Search for `extension_builder`
-  Click :guilabel:`Import and install` on the side of the extension entry

and activate it:

-  Navigate to :guilabel:`Admin Tools > Extensions > Installed Extensions`
-  Search for `extension_builder`
-  Activate the extension by clicking on the :guilabel:`Activate` button in the
   :guilabel:`A/D` column

   On the page ":doc:`Extension Installation <t3install:ExtensionInstallation/Index>`"
