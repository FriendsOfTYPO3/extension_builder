Superfluous dashes in the settings.yaml
^^^^^^^^^^

Because of some important changes it could be necessary to update your :file:`EXT:my_extension/Configuration/ExtensionBuilder/settings.yaml` file manually.

Please remove the dashes, as they could cause some problems while saving the extension.

   Converting propertyIsExcludeField to excludeField
   ^^^^^^^^^^

   If you used a version prior to v12.0.0-beta.3, you might need to change the property `propertyIsExcludeField` to `excludeField` in your TCA ExtensionBuilder.json file manually.

Converting propertyIsExcludeField to excludeField
^^^^^^^^^^

If you used a version prior to `v12.0.0-beta.3`, you might need to change the property `propertyIsExcludeField` for relations to `excludeField` in your TCA ExtensionBuilder.json file manually.

Example:

..  code-block:: json
   :caption: EXT:your_ext/Configuration/ExtensionBuilder/settings.yaml

..  code-block:: json
   :caption: from:

   {
      "nodes": [
         {
            "data": {
               "relations": [
                  {
                     "propertyIsExcludeField": true
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }

..  code-block:: json
   :caption: to:

   {
      "nodes": [
         {
            "data": {
               "relations": [
                  {
                     "excludeField": true
                  }
               ]
            }
         }
      ]
   }
