============================
Publish to TER and Packagist
============================

If your new extension does not reflect the business logic of a specific
customer but serves a general purpose, you might want to release the new
extension and let it become part of the TYPO3 ecosystem.

As much as we encourage you to contribute and live the open source ideas, we
want to keep the quality of the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) high and
therefore ask you to check these questions in advance:

*  Isn't there already an extension in the TER that provides the same
   functionality? If so, wouldn't it be an option to contribute to the existing
   extension?
*  Can you accurately describe the benefits of your extension for the TYPO3
   community?
*  Does your extension include or require external libraries? If so, make sure
   their licensing is compliant.
*  Do you have the resources to maintain this extension?

If you have checked all the questions and are still convinced of the benefits of
publishing your extension, you can secure your extension by reading and applying

* :doc:`/Security/Index`
* :doc:`TYPO3 Extbase and Fluid Guide <t3extbasebook:Index>`
* :doc:`TYPO3 Security Guide <t3coreapi:Security/Index>`

and write appropriate documentation following

* :ref:`documentation`

before publishing the extension on TER and Packagist, following the official
:doc:`publishing guide <t3coreapi-latest:ExtensionArchitecture/HowTo/PublishExtension/Index>`.
