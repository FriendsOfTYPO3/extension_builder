   :Description:
      The Extension Builder helps you to build TYPO3 extensions based on extbase and fluid.
      You can design your model with a graphic modeler and create Plugins or Backend modules.
      All required files are generated and you will have a basic extension where you can insert your domain logic.

      In contrary to the former kickstarter the extension builder has an edit mode that enables the continuous use
      during development. You can modify the autogenerated classes (add new methods, modify the method bodies, add
      comments and annotations) and the extension builder preserves your changes, even if you then rename models or
      properties in the modeler.
