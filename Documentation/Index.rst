   :Description:
      The Extension Builder helps you to build TYPO3 extensions based on Extbase
      and Fluid. You can design your domain model with a graphical modeler and
      create frontend plugins or backend modules. All required files are
      generated and you will have a basic extension where you can insert your
      business logic.

      In addition to the *kickstart mode*, the Extension Builder also provides a
      *roundtrip mode* that allows you to use the graphical editor
      even after you have started making manual changes to the files.
      In this mode, the Extension Builder retains the manual changes,
      such as new methods, changed method bodies, comments and annotations,
      even if you change the extension in the graphical editor.
