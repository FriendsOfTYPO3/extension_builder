Overview of the graphical editor
================================

Go to the backend module of the Extension Builder, the graphical editor will appear directly. At the left side you will see the properties area (1), in which you can setup the extension properties, add authors (2), plugins (3) and modules (4).

Please note that some configuration options are only available if the advanced options are enabled by clicking the :guilabel:`Show advanced options` button in the upper left corner (5) beside the properties area. These options are mainly intended for experienced TYPO3 developers.
