==========
Sponsoring
==========

This extension and manual were created in endless hours, mostly by a few
developers. It is currently maintained on-demand, which means we are collecting
incoming bug reports and feature requests and approving pull requests, but we
are waiting for sponsorship from web agencies and individuals to do the
implementation.

If this extension helps you in any way to meet your business needs, and if you
want to make sure this extension is ready in time for the next TYPO3 release, or
if you need a feature that is not yet implemented, or if you need a bunch of
bugs cleaned out, just let us know. We will find a way to put together a
suitable sponsorship package so that your request can be implemented on time and
in good quality.
