=============================
Publish your extension to TER
=============================

Before you publish your extension to TER you should carefully check these points:

Security
========

Please make sure to check twice all possible security issues. Add access control to all default ControllerActions which
can alter data, as explained in :ref:`user-manual`.

Read these online resources before publishing:

*  :doc:`TYPO3 Extbase and Fluid Guide <t3extbasebook:Index>`
*  :doc:`TYPO3 Security Guide <t3coreapi:Security/Index>`

Documentation
=============

You can use the templates generated by the extension builder to create a reST documentation see: :doc:`Documentation`

Is it useful?
=============

* Please check if there are already similar extensions in TER (before you upload the 56th gallery ;-)
* Does your extension cover a common use case?
