Publish your extension to TER
=============================

Before you publish your extension to TER you should carefully check these points:

Security
--------

Please make sure to check twice all possible security issues. Add access control to all default ControllerActions which
can alter data, as explained in :ref:`user-manual`.

Read these online resources before publishing:

* `Extbase and Fluid Guide <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ExtbaseGuide/Index.html>`_
*  :ref:`TYPO3 Security Guide <t3security:types-of-security-threats>`

Documentation
-------------

You can use the templates generated by the extension builder to create a reST documentation see: :doc:`Documentation`

Is it useful?
-------------

* Please check if there are already similar extensions in TER (before you upload the 56th gallery ;-)
* Does your extension cover a common use case?
