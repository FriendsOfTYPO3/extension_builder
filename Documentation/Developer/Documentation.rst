.. On this page, there are some links using the intersphinx link mechanism (:ref: ...).
   If you are reading the .rst (text) version of this file (and not the rendered version), go to
   https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/extension_builder/Developer/Documentation.html
   to be able to follow the links.

====================
Create Documentation
====================

The extension builder already generated sample documentation for your extension.

#. Rename the :file:`Documentation.tmpl/` folder generated by the extension
   builder to :file:`Documentation/`
#. Adapt the reST files to your extension: Remove unused files, modify existing
   ones and/or create new files.
#. Make sure to also update the file :ref:`h2document:settings-cfg`

The created documentation is written in reStructuredText (reST, file suffix .rst) with
a few additional Sphinx syntax constructs (such as toctree). These are simple text files
with additional markup for lists, headlines, links etc.

You can find out more about how to document with reST / Sphinx in the official documentation:

* :ref:`Introduction to reST & Sphinx <h2document:writing-rest-introduction>`
* :ref:`h2document:rest-cheat-sheet`
* :ref:`h2document:format-rest-cgl`
* :ref:`h2document:rest-common-pitfalls`

.. tip::

   Use an editor or IDE with good reST support, e.g. if you use PhpStorm to edit
   your documentation, install the reStructuredText plugin.

Render reST documentation
=========================

Once you made changes to the generated documentation, you should render it locally.
There are several methods how to render, the recommended method is to use Docker.

Render With the Docker Image
----------------------------

You can use the Docker image `t3docs/docker-render-documentation`.

Find out more: https://github.com/t3docs/docker-render-documentation#quickstart-on-linux-or-macos


Render With the Sphinx Extension
--------------------------------


#. Install the `sphinx <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sphinx>`_ and the
   `restdoc <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/restdoc>`_ extensions

#. Follow the instructions in the video at `Sphinx documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/sphinx/>`_

#. Go to the Spinx Documentation Link in the Help section in the backend and select your extension

#. Select "interactive" as layout to see how your documentation will be displayed on typo3.org
   (don't forget to check the "Always render documentation" when you modified the reST files)


Publish Your Documentation
==========================

Once you publish your extension, your documentation will automatically be rendered on docs.typo3.org.

Look at the `documentation for the extension builder
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/extension_builder/Index.html>`__ for an example.
