Render a reST documentation
===========================

The easiest way to render a documentation for your extension is:

1. Install the `sphinx <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/sphinx>`_ and the `restdoc <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/restdoc>`_ extensions

2. Follow the instructions in the video at `Sphinx documentation <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/sphinx/>`_

3. Rename the :file:`Documentation.tmpl/` folder generated by the extension builder to :file:`Documentation/`

4. Adapt the reST files to your extension: Remove unused files, modify existing ones and/or create new files

5. Go to the Spinx Documentation Link in the Help section in the backend and select your extension

6. Select "interactive" as layout to see how your documentation will be displayed on typo3.org (don't forget to check the "Always render documentation" when you modified the reST files)
