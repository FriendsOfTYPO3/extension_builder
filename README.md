# TYPO3 Extension "extension_builder"

The Extension Builder helps you build and manage your Extbase based TYPO3 extensions.

It ships a graphical editor to build your domain model and generates most of the boiler-plate code necessary for you.
This includes TCA, Models, Repositories and other things.

The editing mode even allows to adjust an existing extension (previously created by Extension Builder).

Keep in mind though that the code created by Extension Builder is only a starting point for you actual implementation of
functionality.

## Which version of Extension Builder to use?

### The Extension Builder GIT version

For each TYPO3 core version there is a branch that matches the minor version.
The master branch of this repository aims to be compatible with the latest development of the TYPO3 core.

We encourage every developer to use the latest matching source directly from github or to load those via composer. 

### The Extension Builder TER version

Even though there is a TER (TYPO3 Extension Repository) release every once in a while, those are for sure not
on a regular basis. We hence suggest to rather stick to our recommendation above and use the github version.
